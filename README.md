# Cat Shelter Website

## Project Introduction

This personal project is designed to enhance my DevOps skills by creating a comprehensive cat shelter website. Inspired by my passion for cats, the website serves as a centralized platform for managing and displaying information about cats in the shelter. Users can access details such as name, breed, age, coloration, and medical records of cats. 

Users can create accounts to become members of the shelter, log in, and utilize various features. The website also includes a section called ‚ÄúI've Found a Pet‚Äù for users to report cats in need of assistance.

### Future Enhancements

In future versions, the website will integrate advanced AI capabilities to:
- Analyze data on cats and users for more effective matching between potential adopters and cats.
- Notify users via email about cats that may be well-suited for adoption based on their preferences and the cats‚Äô profiles.
